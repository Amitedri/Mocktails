        <p>
          Developing any kind of idead with NodeJs and the current
          frameworks/Libararies, made web delopment more dynamic then ever and
          allows of to create really great cotent. everything is possible and
          can be done in many ways so we can scale and maintain great
          performance. Using lazyLoading to prevent long load time for
          e-commerce or Serverless apps, the selection of which technologies to
          use can be really tailored to the project.
